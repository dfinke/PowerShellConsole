# Overview
This repository contains a C# solution for creating a PowerShell console with the AvalonEdit control http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD.
This can then be embedded into another C# application and poof, you've added scripting capabilities to your app.

Here is what the console looks like.
## Highlights
* Code folding
* Syntax highlighting
* Intellisense with *tooltips*
  * Even at the .NET level
    * Type System.
    * Check out $wc. **it too is doing code completion**
